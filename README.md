# Austra
Austra is designed to fulfill the main goal of SPIRE, for students to determine which classes they will be taking and fill out their schedule, in a more intuitive way. Austraâ€™s main features include easily visualizing how classes conflict or mesh using the graphical interface, and viewing feedback for classes and teachers all in the same place. It has a variety of social features including profiles and comments. Just a few more and it would basically be Facebook!

The structure of the repository:

* `docs` - this folder is used to store all documents that are
  requested as part of the submission.
* `src` - this folder is used for your project code.
