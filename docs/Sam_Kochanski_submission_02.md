I contributed to Austra by interpreting our preliminary data model concepts and mostly implementing them into our webapp. In doing so, I solved interesting problems. Specifically, I figured out how to establish a many-to-many relationship with the same table, and figured out how to treat a class method as a model attribute.

I also implemented the instructor list and instructor detail page views. I learned how to use django’s prefab view classes. I wrote the template files for these views, utilizing template conditionals and loops. In doing so it granted me (limited) experience working across the whole stack, from abstract models to actual html.

Lastly, I helped design our relationship with git/github. I certainly won’t take full credit for this, but I suggested we take advantage of github’s more sophisticated features. For example, I suggested that instead of just merging, we all write detailed pull requests that can be reviewed by teammates before changing the master branch.
