I made the most impact on this project on the template / views side of things. I started by finishing Ari's base.html by integrating custom javascript, css and title tags so pages that inherit from it can override them. Once the calendar and index had views and urls.py integration, I worked to fix the calendar. After hours of debugging, I found out that the problem was linking to a remote library. I researched Django static files and integrated that into our app. Other than that, I did the comment system, class detail, and worked on views for other pages. I customized the calendar to display how we wanted. I contributed to the team write-up and headed the Trello push.
