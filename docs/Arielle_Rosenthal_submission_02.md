I made the pretty red header, which I am proud of. 

However the
more substantial contribution I made was "djangofying" the accordian sidebar.
I added courses to def calendar in views.py and used it in main.html.
I made it so that when you expand the accordian you can see each classes rating
and available sessions with corresponding times (in order of start time).

I also did most of the work on the data model diagram and contributed to the video.
